title: 360 UV Printing on Golfballs
description:  At some point I realized that most golfballs only have a logo printed on about a dime sized portion of the ball. After looking into it, the primary method to put this logos onto the ball is by putting dozens of balls in a fixture and printing on the face. So, I made an accessory that would allow for printing fully 360 around a golfball. The largest challenge in this design was getting the print to come out clean. Which required using a speicifc pulley size that was developed by integrating over the curve of the golfball to approximate is as a cylinder and then using this dimension as the driving pulley. This method would likely not work for larger diameter objects, but for a golfball it helped improve the print quality.
