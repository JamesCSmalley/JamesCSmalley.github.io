title: 360 UV Printing on Golfballs
description: During my time at Native Manufacturing, I designed an accessory for our rotary rack device that would allow for printing a full 360 around a golf ball. Until now, the primary method of printing onto goldballfs using a UV printer was by setting them in a jig that would print on the nearest face, about a dime size in area. However, with this device, users can print a full 360 around a golf ball with the width of a quarter coin. The largest challenge in this design was getting the print to come out clean. Which required using a specific pulley size that was developed by integrating over the curve of the golf ball to approximate it as a cylinder and then using this dimension as the driving pulley. This method would likely not work for larger diameter objects, but for a golf ball, it helped improve the print quality.
