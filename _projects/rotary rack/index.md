title: Rotary Rack
description: This project was completed during my time with Native Manufacturing. I worked to develop a method to convert flatbed UV printers to be capable of printing onto cylindrical objects. There is a large market of flatbed UV printers, and we wanted to develop an attachment that could increase the versatility of these machines without needing to buy a different printer. Using Fusion 360 to develop models, I tested a variety of designs through FDM printing and finally machined and produced a device to allow for printing onto cylindrical surfaces. The most difficult part of this project was designing around providing accommodations for users to print on any variety of round, cylindrical, spherical, or tapered objects.
skills: 
- Autodesk Fusion 360
- FDM Rapid Prototyping
